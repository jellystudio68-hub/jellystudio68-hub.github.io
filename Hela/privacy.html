  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last Updated: 2025-09-24</p>
</header>
<main>
  <p>Hela (hereinafter referred to as "we") values the protection of your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your data within our mobile application, <strong>Hela</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). Please read this policy carefully before using the App.</p>

  <div class="note">
    The App is primarily supported by advertising and uses Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT), SKAdNetwork, and Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) as third-party services. If you do not consent to tracking authorization, ads will still be shown but only as “non-personalized ads.”
  </div>

  <h2>1. What Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not require you to create an account, nor do we proactively collect personal data that can directly identify you (such as your name, address, or phone number). However, data processing may occur in the following cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Third-party advertising and attribution services (AdMob, SKAdNetwork) may process the following types of data:
      <ul>
        <li>Device information (e.g., device model, OS version, screen size, language, region)</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA; only available if you grant ATT authorization)</li>
        <li>Approximate location (city/region inferred from IP, not precise GPS location)</li>
        <li>App usage events (e.g., launch, interactions, error logs, depending on SDK implementation)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Version check and announcements: The App fetches remote JSON files (plain text configuration, no executable code) from our static website to display version info or announcements.</li>
    <li>User-initiated contact: If you contact us via email (<a href="mailto:jellystudio68@gmail.com">jellystudio68@gmail.com</a>), we will receive the content you voluntarily provide (e.g., email address, description, screenshots), which will only be used to handle your inquiry.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, maintain, and improve App features and user experience</li>
    <li>To display ads (personalized ads if tracking is authorized; non-personalized ads otherwise)</li>
    <li>To perform basic performance monitoring and debugging</li>
    <li>To respond to inquiries or support requests you initiate</li>
    <li><strong>We do not use the collected data for purposes beyond those described in this policy, such as creating user profiles across apps or websites.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. To provide services, we may share necessary data with the following third parties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob): Provides ad delivery and measurement

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Tracking Authorization (ATT) and Personalized Ads</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App will request authorization through Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework when needed.</li>
    <li>If granted, we and third-party ad partners may use the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) and other signals to deliver more relevant personalized ads.</li>
    <li>If not granted or withdrawn, ads will still be shown but only as “non-personalized.”</li>
    <li>You can manage tracking permissions for this App at any time via iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not proactively create user accounts or store personally identifiable data long-term.</li>
    <li>Data handled or stored by third-party services is subject to their respective data retention policies and security measures.</li>
    <li>Although we have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, no method of transmission or storage over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. If you believe we have collected data from a child without parental or guardian consent, please contact us and we will promptly address the issue.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Links</h2>

  <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy in response to service adjustments or legal changes. Updates will be posted on this page with the latest revision date indicated. In the case of major changes, we will provide clear notice within the App or on our website.</p>
