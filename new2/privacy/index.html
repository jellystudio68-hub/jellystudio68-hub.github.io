  <main>
    <p>
      Hela (hereinafter referred to as "we") values the protection of your personal data.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your data within
      our mobile application, <strong>Hela</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "the App").
      Please read this policy carefully before using the App.

      SKAdNetwork, and Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) as third-party services. If you do not consent to
      tracking authorization, ads will still be shown but only as ‚Äúnon-personalized ads.‚Äù
